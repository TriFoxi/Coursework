I made this following a tutorial, so that I could start to understand and use Unity for future projects. 
It also served as an introduction to using game engines instead of just an interpreter.

It was this tutorial [from brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48LtUkZRjU&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL&index=1) of course.
I almost completely copied it, but it was decently successful enough to let me understand basic game engine and 3D concepts.
